# Flipkart Laptop Review â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents a structured exploratory analysis of laptop reviews sourced from Flipkart. The objective is to identify patterns in customer sentiment, assess product visibility, and understand which features influence high or low ratings. The findings contribute towards developing a decision support system (DSS) for evaluating product performance.

## Overview

This analysis is part of a Decision Support Systems (DSS) assignment for the PG Diploma in Artificial Intelligence at IDEA College, Malta. The dataset consists of 600+ laptop product entries along with user ratings, written reviews, and product specifications.

The notebook uses Python, Jupyter, and libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to clean, visualise, and interpret the data.
